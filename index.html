        <li>Rotary Dial Phone</li>

            <p>The first patent for a <i>rotary dial</i> was granted to American inventor Almon B. Strowger in 1892, however the holes in the finger wheel were not introduced until 1904. However, there was not much <i>rotary dial</i> services in the United States until the introduction of the Western Electric model 50AL in 1919. This phone was the single-most popular dialing style until the 1970s, when modern technology started increasing which led to more developed cell phones that worked faster and that were more efficient. It also works on a pulse-based system. On a <i>rotary phone</i> the digits are organized in a circular motion going counterclockwise, on top of the digits is a circular wheel which allows you to rotate the wheel with your finger. When you release your finger, the wheel then returns to its home position. If you go to older buildings or houses you will see a <i>rotary dial phone</i> sitting on a table as a collectible or hanging on a wall as decoration. There are few <i>rotary dial phones</i> still in use in today’s world due to the increase and development of modern technology. You can still buy <i>rotary phones</i> from stores such as Amazon, eBay, Etsy. A fun fact about the <i>rotary dial phone</i> is that the anti-drug coalition of the Anacostia section of Washington, D.C, got phone companies to install the <i>rotary dial phones</i> in area pay phones. The goal of this was to damper the drug trade since the dials could not be used to call the dealers’ pagers.  </p>

            <p>The <i>Motorola DynaTAC 8000x</i> was the first ever commercial handheld cell phone. <i>DynaTAC</i> is an abbreviation for the phrase “Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage.” This phone was invented by Martin Cooper of Motorola. The <i>Motorola DynaTAC</i> had multiple different prototypes produced for 10 years (between 1973 and 1983). This phone was 33 cm tall (which is 12.99 inches) and weighed just under a kilogram (which is 2 pounds). This phone took approximately 10 hours to fully recharge and it only offered 30 minutes of time to talk. This phone would only allow you to store 30 numbers and it cost $3,995 (around $10,000 in today’s terms) when it launched. Once it was first released there were many models that were following it. This phone was first begun at Bell Labs which is an Americal industrial research and scientific development company that is owned by Finnish company Nokia. The concept was to cover the world with a network of hexagonal cells, each of which would send and receive messages to other phones. This would end up being completed by the 1970s and was called the Bell Labs Advance Mobile Phone System (AMPS). Compared to phones nowadays, people would think this phone is too big for them. However, at this time in the world all mobile telephones were huge, bulky phones that were installed in vehicles or in heavy briefcases. This was the first phone that allowed people to connect to other telephones without the help of a mobile operator and could be used only by the user.  </p>

            <p>The first apple iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, after speculation for years that they were creating a new phone. Apple started production on this phone in 2005 and it was released in 2007 which means it took them approximately 2 years to develop this phone. Apple produced this device during a secretive and unprecedented collaboration with Cingular Wireless, which is now a part of AT&T. No-one thought that this type of phone was possible to make, and when it did get released and worked people were in disbelief of what just came out. The slogans for Apple during this time were “This is only the beginning” and “Apple reinvents the phone.” <i>The first-generation iPhone</i> only costs approximately $500. This was one of the first handheld phones to where you could browse the internet on a screen that was big enough to see on. It allowed for there to be no more physical hardware buttons on the front of your phone, instead, it allowed for it to be a touch screen with limited buttons. This phone could only hold around 16 GB of data and has a very low-resolution camera. There have been approximately 6.1 million units sold to date. This phone was only 0.46 inches think and had a screen size diagonally of 3.5 inches and it only weighed 4.8 ounces (0.3 pounds). This phone was only exclusive to AT&T, which led to the phone running very slowly, which made the costumers very mad because they felt it was unreliable. </p>
