            <p>The first patent for a rotary dial was granted to American inventor Almon B. Strowger in 1892, however the holes in the finger wheel were not introduced until 1904. However, there was not much rotary dial services in the United States until the introduction of the Western Electric model 50AL in 1919. This phone was the single-most popular dialing style until the 1970s, when modern technology started increasing which led to more developed cell phones that worked faster and that were more efficient. On a rotary phone the digits are organized in a circular motion going counterclockwise, on top of the digits is a circular wheel which allows you to rotate the wheel with your finger. When you release your finger, the wheel then returns to its home position. If you go to older buildings or houses you will see a rotary dial phone sitting on a table as a collectible or hanging on a wall as decoration. There are few rotary dial phones still in use in today’s world due to the increase and development of modern technology. You can still buy rotary phones from stores such as Amazon, eBay, Etsy. A fun fact about the rotary dial phone is that the anti-drug coalition of the Anacostia section of Washington, D.C, got phone companies to install the rotary dial phones in area pay phones. The goal of this was to damper the drug trade since the dials could not be used to call the dealers’ pagers.  </p>
